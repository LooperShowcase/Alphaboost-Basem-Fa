<h2>Development of the Model S began prior to 2007, under the codename "WhiteStar". The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. The Model S debuted on June 22, 2012.[8] A revised, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted on October 9, 2014. The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive the standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. Along with these updates, Tesla offered the Autopilot driving assistance system. In April 2016, the Model S was updated with a new front hood design. In October of the same year, hardware became standard that supports Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) capability. As part of the update, integrated standard cameras around the car were added. In February 2017 the Tesla Model S P100D debuted, which included a revised motor and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range exceeding 300 miles (483 km). A refresh of the Tesla Model S, codenamed "Palladium", was introduced in June 2021, offering a new "Plaid" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension.

    The Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013[9][10][11][12] and in Denmark in December 2015.[13] Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.[14][15][16][17] The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.[18][19][20] Upon its release, the Model S received positive reviews, with praise for its acceleration and range, although initial models received criticism for their high cost and braking issues.</h2>

    <h2>The Tesla Model 3 is a compact executive sedan that is battery powered and produced by Tesla.[7] Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017.[8][9][10] The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took place on July 28.[11]

        The base Model 3 delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of 272 miles (438 km) and the Long Range version delivers 358 miles (576 km).[12] According to Tesla, the Model 3 carries full self-driving hardware, with periodic software updates adding functionality.[13][14][15]
        
        The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than previous models by Tesla. Since early 2020, the Model 3 is the bestselling electric car in world history,[16] and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to pass the 1 million global sales milestone.[17] The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in electric car (PEV) for three years running, from 2018 to 2020.[18][19][20] It has also been the bestselling PEV in the United States for three consecutive years, 2018 to 2020,[21][22][23] the top selling PEV in Europe in 2019,[24] and the bestselling PEV in China in 2020.[25]</h2>

<h2>The Tesla Model Y is a battery electric compact crossover manufactured by Tesla, Inc. Unveiled in March 2019,[3] it started production at its Fremont plant in January 2020,[4] and started deliveries on March 13, 2020.[5]

The Model Y is based on the Model 3 sedan platform.[6] It shares an estimated 75 percent of its parts with the Tesla Model 3,[7] which includes a similar interior and exterior design and electric powertrain. The Model Y fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the mid-sized Tesla Model X.[8] Like the Model X, the Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity.[9][10][11]

There were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model Y: Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, Long Range with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD), and Performance (with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive).[12][13] The Long Range AWD model and the Performance model are currently being delivered.[14] The Standard Range RWD configuration was initially canceled in July 2020, due to the range (230 mi or 370 km EPA) being unacceptably low to CEO Elon Musk, but was orderable as of January 2021 (with 244 mi or 393 km of EPA range).[15][16] By February 7, 2021, the Long Range RWD appears to have been canceled.[17] As of December 6, 2021, Tesla formally notified people who had pre-ordered the Long Range RWD that their chosen configuration is no longer available.</h2>

  <h2>The Tesla Model X is a battery electric mid-size luxury crossover SUV produced by Tesla, Inc. since 2015. Developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S, the vehicle is notable in that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access.

The Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV,[5] and shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S, half of the originally planned 60 percent, and weighs about 10 percent more. Both the Model X and Model S are produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne, California on February 9, 2012.[9][10] First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.[11] After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's best-selling plug-in cars.[12]

As of February 19, 2023, the Model X is only available as the Long Range with an estimated EPA range of 351 miles (565 km) and the Plaid model with an estimated EPA range of 333 miles (536 km).[13][14] Both come with Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system.[15]

<h2>The Tesla Cybertruck is an upcoming battery electric light-duty truck announced by Tesla, Inc. in November 2019. Three models have been announced, with EPA range estimates of 400–800 kilometers (250–500 mi) and an estimated 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 2.9–6.5 seconds, depending on the model.</h2>
<h2>The stated goal of Tesla in developing the Cybertruck is to provide a sustainable energy substitute for the roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered trucks sold per day in the United States of America.</h2>
<h2>The base price of the rear-wheel drive (RWD) model of the vehicle was announced to be US$39,900, with all-wheel drive (AWD) models starting at US$49,900. Production of the dual-motor AWD and tri-motor AWD Cybertruck were initially slated to begin in late 2021, with the RWD model release date in late 2022, but production dates were pushed back multiple times. As of July 2022, the start of limited production is estimated to start in mid-2023. As of January 2023, the start of mass production was estimated to be in 2024. However, as of February 2023, Elon Musk stated that the Cybertruck will be available later in 2023 with deliveries planned to begin by the end of Q3 2023.</h2>
