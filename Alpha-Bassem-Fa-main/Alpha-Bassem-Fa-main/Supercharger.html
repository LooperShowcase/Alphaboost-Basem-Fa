   <h2>A Tesla Supercharger is a 480-volt direct current fast-charging technology built by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. for electric cars. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, with six Supercharger stations. As of April 2023, Tesla operates more than 45,000 Superchargers with more than 5,000 stations worldwide, an average of over 9 chargers per station. As of April 2023 there were 1,966 stations in North America, 2,069 in the Asia/Pacific region, and 985 in Europe. Supercharger stalls have a connector to supply electrical power at maximums of 72 kW, 150 kW or 250 kW, depending on the Supercharger generation.</h2>

   <h2>Tesla Model S was the first car to be able to use the network, followed by the Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and Tesla Model Y. Some Tesla cars have free supercharging for life, while others have annual or one-time credits. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed, although stations in jurisdictions that prohibit billing-by-consumption instead bill by time spent charging. An idle fee may be charged (depending on the percent occupancy of the Supercharger station) for continuing to be plugged into the Supercharger after charging has been completed.


    Tesla has taken steps to focus the use of the Superchargers on making longer journeys. In late 2017, Tesla restricted commercial, ride-hailing service, taxicab, and government usage of the public Supercharger network, requiring paying on a pay-per-use basis.</h2>
